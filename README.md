## My process

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

This project was mostly review for me, but there's always something to learn. I dove back into SASS since I haven't used it in a little bit but have been wanting to use it again. I also learned to contain an image in a div when it's overflowing by setting a max-height and max-width to the image. I wasn't able to match the fonts perfectly since I'm not great at recognizing most fonts (some I can though, looking at you comic sans) and some of the styles aren't spot on since I don't have the exact dimensions.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me with referencing flexbox
